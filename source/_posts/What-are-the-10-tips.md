#  Who compiled the list?

In compiling the list of the world's richest people, several different sources were consulted to come up with an accurate and definitive ranking.

# How was the wealth calculated?

The net worth of each individual on the list was calculated using their estimated wealth as of January 2019. This includes all assets - such as property, investments, and cash - minus any liabilities.

# What are the different sources?

The three main sources used in compiling the list were Forbes, Bloomberg, and Wealth-X. Each source used different methodologies in determining the wealth of each individual, so discrepancies between rankings are to be expected. However, when taken together, the three lists provide a fairly accurate overview of who is wealthiest in the world.

# Who tops the list?
